# South-Africa---Residential-Property-Price-Index-2010-2023

# ABSTRACT
The Residential Property Price Index (RPPI) for South Africa was compiled by Statistics South Africa in partnership with the
South African Reserve Bank and with the support of the International Monetary Fund. The source data for the RPPI are the
records of property transactions registered with the Office of the Chief Registrar of Deeds (Deeds office). The RPPI is
compiled using internationally accepted methods as outlined in Eurostat's Handbook on Residential Property Price Indices
and the IMF's Residential Property Price Index Practical Compilation Guide. These documents are provided with the data. The
indices are calculated using a rolling window time dummy hedonic regression model. The purpose of RPPIs is to measure
changes in the price of residential properties, such as houses, townhouses and flats, purchased by households. Both new
and existing dwellings are covered, independently of their final use and their previous owners. Only market prices are
considered, including the price of the land on which residential buildings are located.
